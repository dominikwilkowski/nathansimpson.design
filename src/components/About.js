        <h2>The Here and Now</h2>
        <p>I am studying the Bachelor of Design (Visual Communication) at Western Sydney University in Parramatta NSW. After completing a web design unit, followed by 'Programming Fundamentals', I developed an interest in coding. Since then I have been an active student on TreeHouse, to learn JavaScript, React and Swift. I am also a regular attendee at <a href="https://www.sydjs.com/" target="_blank">SydJS</a> meetup events.</p>
        <p>I am currently working in an eLearning services company in North Sydney. On the side of my regular development, training and support roles, I have created an entire new website for the company, and created some custom automation software that integrates with their CRM. I am also still actively freelancing on the side of my work and uni.</p>

        <h2>The Back Story</h2>
        <p>I was born in Orange NSW to a Police Officer and a Nurse.</p>
        <p>From a young age, I showed an interest and an understanding for technology and I enjoyed drawing cars when I should have been listening in class. I developed an interest in Apple when I was 10, because I was attracted to the Industrial and the User Experience Design that went into each product, and the branding and marketing that followed it.</p>
        <p>When I was 12 my Dad left the Police Force, and decided to start his own business. Designing his logo was my first experience with Graphic design. I found my passion and began practicing with Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
        <p>For my HSC Major Design Project, I branded 'Nathan Simpson Graphic Design', and started my campaign to get into the public eye as a professional Graphic Designer. It all paid off when my Major Project was nominated for inclusion in an exhibition at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.</p>
        <p>After finishing high school, I began learning HTML and CSS, before jumping into PHP and creating custom Wordpress themes for clients. I moved to Sydney in 2015, and continued freelancing.</p>
