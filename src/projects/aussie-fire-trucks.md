[Aussie Fire Trucks](http://www.aussiefiretrucks.com) was my first custom development project. After spending a couple years working in HTML & CSS, as well as Wordpress, I wanted to build something myself and further explore some of the development technologies I had picked up. My Wordpress experience taught me a little about MySQL and PHP, so using what little skills I had, and a lot of Googling, I was able to build a very simple search engine from scratch.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a firefighter, and drive the big red Fire Engines. Even today I am in awe when I see them drive past with the lights and sirens on, and I was inspired to join the State Emergency Service. Joining a Facebook community of ‘Fire Engine Spotters’ gave me the inspiration to build an app where you could search for a specific Fire Engine, and find out more information about it, such as it’s station history, and it’s unique fleet number. Although I am not actively working on this app, I am making the code open on GitHub so anyone can pick it apart and make their own basic search engine.
